## Front-end password check

<p>This functionality checks if the password contain Upper character, Number, Special character, and length between 10 and 16 characters.</p>
<p>Beyond that, finish register button is activated only if this requirements are accomplished and the first password and confirmation are the same.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't prevent malicious user modify the function through DevTools and submit an unsafe password, therefore we worked to prevent bad requests</p>

## Backend password check

<p>To prevent these possible bad requests, we validate passwords submited into a view, checking the requirements, registring only if requirements were accomplished</p>
<p>The view were tested, checking if it works appropriately</p>
